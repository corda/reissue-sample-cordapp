# Re-issuance Sample CorDapp 
This CorDapp is re-issuance demo and demonstrates how to use re-issuance flows.

Re-issuance CorDapp: https://github.com/corda/reissue-cordapp

## Running the sample

Deploy and run the nodes by:
```
./gradlew deployNodes
./build/nodes/runnodes
```
if you have any questions during setup, please go to https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html for detailed setup instructions.

Once all nodes are started up (Notary, Issuer, Alice & Bob), create a token asset. In Issuer's node shell, run:
```
flow start IssueDemoAppTokens tokenHolderParty: Alice, tokenAmount: 50L
```
